  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Thank you for using ToolNest (https://mohitsingh9099.github.io/ToolNest/). Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you use our website.

<h2></h2>1. Information We Collect
<p></p>ToolNest is a multi-tool utility website designed to be simple, fast, and privacy-friendly. We follow a no-login and no-tracking philosophy. Therefore:

We do NOT collect any personal information (such as your name, email, or address).

We do NOT use cookies for tracking or analytics.

We do NOT share your data with any third parties.

However, depending on the tools you use, we may temporarily process information locally in your browser. For example:

Text or files uploaded for conversion or compression stay on your device and are never sent to a server.

Some tools may access browser APIs for functionalities like speech, clipboard, or screen capture — all of which require your explicit permission.

<h2></h2>2. Third-Party Services
<p></p>ToolNest does not integrate any third-party analytics, ads, or trackers.

If we ever embed external services (like a file hosting API, text-to-speech engine, etc.), we will clearly notify users within that specific tool. You are always in control.

<h2></h2>3. Local Storage
<p></p>Some tools may use your browser’s local storage to save preferences or settings. This data:

Is stored only on your device

Is never transmitted to our servers

Can be cleared by you at any time via your browser settings

<h2></h2>4. Security
<p></p>While ToolNest does not collect or store your data, we still take your privacy seriously:

The website is served via HTTPS for secure communication

All processing is handled client-side (in your browser) wherever possible

<h2></h2>5. Children's Privacy
<p></p>ToolNest is designed for a general audience and does not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. If you believe we have unintentionally collected such data, please contact us, and we will remove it immediately.

<h2></h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
<p></p>We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally. All changes will be posted on this page with a new effective date. We encourage users to check this page regularly.

<h2></h2>7. Contact
